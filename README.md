Overall Goal:
    The project likely aims to synthesize or clone voice audio by generating a new audio file that matches the input text using reference audio as a style or voice guide.

Steps and Components:
    1. Input:
    Sample Audio File:
        A voice recording serves as a reference to extract the speaker's voice features or style.

    Input Text:
        A string of text that represents what the synthesized audio will say.

    2. Step 1 - VQGAN Encoder:
        The VQGAN Encoder extracts voice features from the sample audio file. These features represent the unique characteristics of the speaker's voice, such as pitch, tone, and cadence. The features are then converted into voice tokens for further processing.

    3. Step 3 - Processing (LLaMA Model):
    The LLaMA model:
        Uses the input text to understand the content that needs to be generated.
        Incorporates the voice tokens (features of the reference voice) to match the style and tone of the speaker.
        Processes these inputs to generate semantic tokens, which act as intermediate representations of the synthesized speech.

    4. Step 4 - Output (VQGAN Decoder):
    The VQGAN Decoder:
        Converts the semantic tokens back into an audio waveform, producing the final generated audio.
        This audio matches the text content while maintaining the style and tone of the reference voice.

Objective:
-The project aims to create a system that can:
-Clone a voice from a given audio sample.
-Generate new audio that sounds like the reference speaker but says entirely new text.
-Leverage advanced models like VQGAN (for audio encoding/decoding) and LLaMA (for text and semantic processing).
